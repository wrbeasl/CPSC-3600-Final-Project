Instructions:
1) In order to compile the code for execution, open up a terminal and navigate to the containing folder. Once in this folder, type the command "./make". This command is a part of the included makefile and will compile and generate all the code and executables. From there, open up another terminal and navigate it also to the containing folder. The next thing you will want to do is start the server. In order to do this, in one of the open terminal windows, type: "./Server <Robot ID> <Host Name> <UDP Port>" Replacing the values in "< >" with the associated values listed above. Once the server has started, in the other terminal window, run the command "./Client <UDP Server IP> <UDP Port> in order to have the client connect to the UDP Server. From there, the client will run through a pre-programmed order of commands and print the output to the Client's terminal.
